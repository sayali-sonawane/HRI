List of Project Ideas

Personalized Tutoring

Tool training: Robot instructs best practices to use tools
Encouraging/measuring engagement during instruction
Plan triage: Robot intercedes when human is executing a bad plan
Physical form/pose coaching: Sports and therapy applications
Safe Motion Planning

Communicate intention of motion / social navigation
Adapting dangerous task execution in presence of human (to minimize potential harm)
Build motion models from human activity in various contexts (e.g., task, time of day, location/environment)
Robot monitors human to enforce safe behavior (e.g., drowsy driver)
Predicting human task plans
Robot capable of finding and tracking a person based on their voice and then computer vision
Simulated Microgravity Navigation with Augmented Reality Path Planning and Motion Previews
Non-verbal Behaviors

Learning to maximize engagement for invasive tasks (e.g., handing out leaflets to people, making announcements that are remembered)
Non-verbal behaviors to increase/recover engagement
Using context to assess appropriateness of various communication modalities
Determining group leader / detecting group dynamics
Model affective state through reading non-verbal behaviors (changing someone's state through manipulation)
Using affective response of human to parameterize actions (e.g., move slowly if human is afraid)
Parameterization of attention by observing the body language
Human-Robot Trust

Embedding active listening within the robots to make empathetic connections and engender trust.
Using non-verbal cues for collaboration/trust
Dynamic variability of assigning task based on assessment of trust and skills
Handing bulky object to a human and assessing human readiness / capability (is person grabbing safe areas etc).
Synchronizing Mental Models of Tasks or Actions

A system for working with multiple robots and humans where each robot independently decides what information it needs to share to the other robots and/or humans based on the its capabilities, the other robot's capabilities, and the humans.
Modeling objects and getting the bottom-up cost estimation during negotiation or cost analysis.
Building a model of human perception to estimate human knowledge of scene
Editing of GMM keyframed tasks using constraints to develop new skills
Human-Robot Collaboration

Robot communicates desires/needs it can't complete on it's own so human can aid robot in completing a task.
During a fetching task, report back what else is at an objects location that apply to the current task at hand
A cooking assistant robot capable of handling requests such as 'pass me 2 onions' or 'stir this until the garlic is golden brown.' Going further, the robot could become context-aware based on what's being cooked and add ingredients at the right time.
Robot adjusting search pattern based on human location/movement during a search task
